        Hello, world! My name is Taufik Hidayat. I&apos;m a Junior Back-end Developer, Computer Science Student,
        YouTuber, Free and Open Source Software Enthusiast, and GNU/Linux Nerd. I live in Bandung, Indonesia. I was born
        in Majalengka, 1 April 2002 (21 years old).
      </p>
      <p className='text-justify text-light-fg-secondary dark:text-dark-fg-secondary'>
        I&apos;ve gained some valuable experience in this field, particularly in web development. I am deeply passionate
        about pursuing a career as a Back-end Developer, with a strong focus on specializing in TypeScript and Golang.
        Iâ€™m also a fast learner and self-taught. Over the past few years, I have acquired knowledge in numerous new
        technologies by actively exploring the vast resources available on the internet.
